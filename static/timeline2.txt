Only thing that could have made that HR feel better is if they cut to a sad Ted Cruz reaction shot

FWIW: I love that there are folks who want to come into a movie clean, I think thatâ€™s awesome. Me, Iâ€™m a weak man. I watch ALL THE TRAILERS

Keeping with a theme: https://t.co/oBibECJxw6
I a legitimately torn. If you want to come in clean, absolutely avoid it. 

But itâ€™s gooooood..... https://t.co/Y29K5yz8i4
